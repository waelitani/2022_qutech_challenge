## Description 

The file provides the basis for locating and moving objects inside a game, built on top of the lattice Boltzmann framework. The initialization is impelemented using the number binary basis for bosonic operators, allowing for describing a numerical evolution of the object of choice is desired. Templates for streaming objects in the backward/forward direction in each dimension are provided. The lattice Boltzmann method describes the position of an object in terms of a distribution, allowing for games to make of features of a quantum system in its concepts e.g. an object is spread across the entire domain, and collecting requires visiting the entire landplot.

##  iQuHack Experience

This has been the first hackathon I take part of in a few years. While the minimum required team member count is three, I have chosen to remain solo and opt out of being considered for the prize. I have rather used the event as a motivation to code at a very basic level the algorithms which so far I have only been studying theoretically.
